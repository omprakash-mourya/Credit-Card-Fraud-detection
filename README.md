# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection

A comprehensive machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. This project was developed as part of my data science portfolio to showcase end-to-end ML engineering skills including handling imbalanced datasets, model interpretability, and production deployment.

## üéØ Project Motivation

After reading about the massive financial losses due to credit card fraud (over $28 billion globally in 2023), I wanted to build a robust detection system that could help financial institutions minimize these losses while maintaining a good customer experience. This project focuses on the technical challenges of working with highly imbalanced data and the business considerations of false positive/negative trade-offs.

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- 284,807 transactions over 2 days
- 492 fraudulent transactions (0.17% of all transactions)
- PCA-transformed features (V1-V28) to protect customer privacy
- Highly imbalanced: ~577 normal transactions for every fraud case

**Why This Dataset?**
I chose this dataset because it represents real-world challenges in fraud detection:
- Extreme class imbalance mimics actual fraud rates
- Privacy-protected features simulate production environments
- Temporal aspects require careful train/test splitting
- 30 features: Time, Amount, and V1-V28 (PCA-transformed features)
- Highly imbalanced: ~577:1 ratio of normal to fraud transactions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd credit-card-fraud

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Data Preparation

```bash
# Create data directory
mkdir data

# Download creditcard.csv from Kaggle and place it in data/
# The file should be located at: data/creditcard.csv
```

### 3. Model Training

```bash
# Train models (this will take several minutes)
python -m src.train

# This will create:
# - models/pipeline.joblib (preprocessing pipeline)
# - models/xgb_model.joblib (trained XGBoost model)
```

### 4. Launch Demo Application

```bash
# Run Streamlit app (make sure you're in the project root directory)
