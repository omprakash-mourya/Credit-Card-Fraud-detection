# Performance Optimization Notes

## Memory Usage Optimization (Week 2)
- **Issue**: Original implementation loaded entire 280k+ dataset into memory
- **Solution**: Implemented chunked processing for large datasets
- **Impact**: Reduced memory usage from 2.1GB to 450MB

## Model Training Speed (Week 2)  
- **Issue**: Full grid search was taking 4+ hours
- **Solution**: Switched to RandomizedSearchCV with 20 iterations
- **Impact**: Training time reduced from 4h to 45 minutes

## Streamlit Caching Problems (Week 3)
- **Issue**: Model parameters weren't updating due to aggressive caching
- **Solution**: Implemented selective cache clearing and proper cache keys
- **Impact**: Real-time parameter tuning now works correctly

## Feature Engineering Experiments
- **Tried**: Polynomial features, interaction terms, time-based features
- **Result**: PCA-transformed data made most feature engineering ineffective
- **Learning**: Sometimes simpler is better - focused on sampling and algorithms instead

## SMOTE Parameter Tuning
- **Experiment**: Tested k_neighbors from 3 to 10
- **Finding**: k=5 gave best results on validation set
- **Insight**: Too few neighbors = overfitting, too many = smoothing fraud patterns

## Threshold Optimization Journey
- **Initial**: Used default 0.5 threshold
- **Business Context**: False negative costs $100, false positive costs $5
- **Final**: Optimal threshold at 0.23 based on cost-benefit analysis
- **Result**: 15% improvement in business value

## Code Quality Improvements
- **Week 1**: Everything in Jupyter notebooks
- **Week 2**: Extracted reusable functions
- **Week 3**: Full modular architecture with proper testing
- **Week 4**: Added type hints, docstrings, and error handling
